â€“a new study suggests that orthodontic brackets are more susceptible to the corrosion process of metal ions that can lead to the loss of substance from the material, change in its structural characteristics, or loss of structural integrity, the New York Times reports. The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the Journal of the American Journal of Medicine, found that the metal ions in the brackets can be released by the presence of dissimilar metals (i.e. the silver solder and the stainless steel) in soldered brackets, a phenomenon known as galvanic corrosion, which can be seen as a phenomenon called " galvanic
