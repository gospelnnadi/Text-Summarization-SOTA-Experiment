– If you're a 5-foot guy to a basketball player who's over 7 feet tall, then that basketball player has around twice the risk of cancer across the board, says an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Riverside. He also found that taller people were at much higher risk of melanoma, and women specifically had greater odds of developing thyroid cancer. "Now, you can’t do anything about your height, but what you can do is tell extremely tall individuals that they should be aware," he says. But it doesn't mean tall people should panic.
