â€“a new system that can be used to cut a workpiece by moving the workpiece along a trajectory by guarded moves, and then machining the work piece by moving it along the trajectory and controlling the trajectory in real time, the New York Times reports. "The invention is useful for performing edge finishing on intricately designed workpieces or work pieces or workpieces with close edge finishing tolerances," the company says in a press release. "It's useful to perform edge finishing in the future, and it can be machined from the learned trajectory without expensive fixtures by the sensors and software locating the tool and adjusting the
