This paper focuses on the effects of public health intervention on malnutrition, particularly among school aged students in the poor areas of shiran. The study is based on an iranan school population and involves three groups: 1) education and justifying; 2) research and evaluation; and 3) executive group. In this case, all schools are provided with a variety of food options for both groups. Education and justification has been used to educate parents about the benefits of the project. After six months of follow-up, the results show that there is no significant difference in the severity or frequency of malnourished student's underweight.
