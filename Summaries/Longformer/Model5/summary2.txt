</s><s><s><s>In this paper, the authors present the results of a study on the prevalence of underweight and malnourished school children in shiraz, iran. The authors assess the effect of a six-month long intervention designed by the university's obesity and nutrition advocacy team on the "prevalence of under weight in school aged children in the poor area of Shiraz. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, the students are randomly selected from two elementary schools and one middle school in the third region of the city. They are then enrolled in a free snack package along with other food and water supplies. After the intervention has been implemented in two schools, the disease control and prevention office of the local government receives a report on the response following the intervention. Although there is no significant difference in the rate of morbidity or mortality between the wealthy and poor students, there is a significant increase in the proportion of healthy eating for both genders. The cause of this change is attributed to the introduction of whole grains in the school lunches. Following this point, the work of the advocacy team is extended to include parents as well as representatives from several governmental and non-governmental organizations. The final product consists of a set of educational pamphlets targeted at all levels of the school and encourages parents to engage their children in healthier eating habits.</s>
