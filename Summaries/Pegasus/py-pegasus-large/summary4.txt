key points Key points: Taller people have more cells in their body, as well as higher levels of a protein that encourages cells to divide and grow For every 10cm over the average height, a person’s risk for cancer increases 10 per cent New analysis of data from big cancer studies supports this, and also finds a few specific cancers to be more or less strongly correlated with height Leonard Nunney, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Riverside, looked at massive cancer databases to find out how the number of cells in a person’s body, using height as a proxy, might affect their risk of developing cancer. Reporting in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, he found being taller and having more cells did mean more cancer overall: For every 10 centimetres over the average height, the risk of developing any cancer increased by around 10 per cent.
